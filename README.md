    <td valign="top"><b>2pts</b><br><br>* The submitted solution includes the required header documentation (name, date, purpose). <br><br>* Header documentation includes appropriate modification comments if the submitted solution is a modification to a previously submitted program. <br><br>* Code is properly formatted. Open and close brackets are properly aligned and code within the brackets is appropriately indented. <br><br>* All variables are self-documented (i.e. named in such a way that the name indicates the purpose of the variable).
</td>
    <td valign="top"><b>1pts</b><br><br>* The submitted solution includes the some, but not ALL, of the required header documentation (name, date, purpose). <br><br>* In the case of modifications to a previously submitted program, modification comments are missing or incomplete. <br><br>* Code is unformatted and difficult to follow. Brackets aren't aligned and/or code within brackets is not indented. <br><br>* Numerous variable names are ambiguous (i.e. x) and do not indicate the purpose of the variable.
